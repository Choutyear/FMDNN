# FMDNN
FMDNN: A Fuzzy-guided Multi-granular Deep Neural Network for Histopathological Image Classification

## 1. Project Overview

As shown in the figure below, FMDNN consists of three modules, **Multi-granular Feature Extraction Module** conducts feature extraction on the input image at three distinct granularities, **Universal Fuzzy Feature Module** extracts the universal fuzzy feature of the image, and **Fuzzy-guided Cross-attention Module** performs feature fusion by linear transformation and dimension alignment to get the final classification result.
